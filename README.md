# Mechatronics and Robotics Fundamentals Repository

## Overview:
Hello Explorer! I am Uncle Leandawn and I am here to show the following Prerequisites, Fundamentals, Tools and Repositories in starting your career as a Mechatronics Engineer. Mechatronics is multidisciplinary field composed of Mechanical Engineering, Electronics Engineering, Computer Science, and Control Engineering. Given its complexity of systems, Mechatronics Engineers ensures the integration of different disciplines and providing automation in this Industry 4.0.

## Who am I?
A Third-Year Mechatronics Engineering Student at the Philippines with goals of going in-depth in Automation and Robotics. Nothing extraordinary with it.

## How is this structured?
The following repository will constructed with this fashion:

1. Core Engineering Mathematics
2. Core Engineering Sciences
    - Electrical and Electronics
    - Mechanical
    - Control
    - Computer Science
4. Core Fundamentals of Mechatronics
5. In-depth Robotics (will be updated once I study in Graduate Studies).
6. Tools, Softwares, to use in your career.

## Repository:

### Core Engineering Mathematics
It is advised to review the [College Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/college-algebra), [Trigonometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry), and [Pre-Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus) first. Though Statistics and Probability are important in study of Engineering, it is not highlighted in the first few Engineering Mathematics Courses since Statistics and Probability require Calculus-based approach.

#### Calculus 1 - Limits and Derivatives
Calculus 1 is known to be as "Differential Calculus". The following subjects covers the "tangent problem". With a prerequisite fundamental understanding of infestisimals, and infinities. The subject discusses Limits, The First Principles of Derivative, Derivatives of Algebraic and Transcendental Functions, Derivative Rules, and Application of Derivatives (Related Rates, Optimization Problems, etc.)

#### Calculus 2 - Integrals and Integration Techniques
Calculus 2 is the continuation of Calculus 1. This one discusses the concept of a "Anti-derivative" or the "Integral". And how the "Fundamental Theorem of Calculus" takes place. This subject discusses, Integrals as the Anti-Derivatives of Algebraic and Transcendental Functions, Algebraic Subsitution, The Different Integration Techniques such as Partial Fractions, Integration by Parts, Trigonometric Subsitution, Integral Tables, Application of Integrals (Solid of Revolutions, Mean Value Theorem, Physics Problems, etc.). Will add the Calculus of Series and Convergence Tests.

#### Calculus 3 - Parametric Equations, Vector, and Vector Calculus
Calculus 3 is the Continuation of the two First Calculus courses. Since Calculus 1 and 2 tackles the problems in one variable. This Calculus courses focuses on the multivariable or functions of two or more dependent variables. This subject tackles the introduction of three dimensional coordinates systems, Introduction to Vectors and Vector Operations, Introduction to Parametric Equations and Usability on Real Life Systems, Partial Derivatives, Multiple Integrals, Vector Fields, and Different Theorems.

#### Differential Equations
Differential Equations may consider as one of the components in Calculus 3, but in the Engineering Schools tend to have it as a separate subject. Differential Equations are equations that include a derivative or a differential. This is mostly seen to model real life systems in mathematical terms. This subject covers Ordinary Differential Equations, First-Order and Higher Order Linear Differentiall Equations. Partial Differential Equations mainly doesn't tackle on this program but mainly used on Pure Mathematics and Theoretical Physics Programs.

#### Complex Analysis
Complex Analysis is the study of the complex numbers and variables. This includes the Complex Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Roots, and Exponents of Complex Numbers (Trigonometric Values, Logarithmic Values) and Variables. This subject also covers the Complex Differentiation and Complex Integration as well and how Complex Numbers compare to Vectors.

#### Linear Algebra
Linear Algebra is the study of numbers represented in a linear space. This has great applications in Differential Equations, Complex Analysis, and Robotics Computaions. This subject discusses the Matrix and Matrix Operations, Solving of Linear Systems by Inverse of a Matrix, Determinants, and Linear Transformations. Can be a co-requisite to Calculus 3 but not required to.

#### Transform Theory
Transform Theory in mathematics is the study of different transforms of functions. Can be a co-requisite to Calulus 3, and Linear Algebra. This subject has application when studying Control Systems and Signal Systems Processing. This Subject will only tackle the Fourier Transform, Laplce Transform, and z-transform.
